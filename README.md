## Getting Started with Docker

1. Build docker image

    ```bash
    bin/build-env.sh
<<<<<<< HEAD
    ```bash
=======
    ```
>>>>>>> ce063127928fe81d4499666a6e71e06114bf52e7

2. Run docker image

    ```bash
    #Usage bin/run-env.sh <port - optional(default 8081)>
    bin/run-env.sh
    ```
    
3. Build project web server (inside docker image) NOTE: You won't be able to `cd` here yet because the project directory does not exist. If you were able to launch the above commands you should now be inside the docker image. You can exit it with CTRL+D now.

    ```bash
    # Inside docker image
    cd /home/user/repo/project
    make
    ```
    
4. Run web server (inside docker image)

    ```bash
    # MUST be within project/ directory inside docker image
    cd /home/user/repo/project
    ./bin/run.sh
    ```
